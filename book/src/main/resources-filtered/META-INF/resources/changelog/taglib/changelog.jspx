			<ul>
				<li>New project to assist in formatting changelogs.</li>
				<li>
					Taglib tlib-version is now set automatically during build.
					Unfortunately, we cannot include "-SNAPSHOT" on snapshot builds due to the requirement of "Dewey decimal"
					for taglib versions.  The unambiguous full version is annotated via comment.
				</li>
				<li>"release-notes-\${version}" id moved to overall release section so links go to overall release.
					Previously they went specifically to the release notes and the release version was scrolled
					off the top of the browser.  This keeps things in context.
				</li>
				<li>"Release Notes" section no longer included when the release tag has no JSP body.</li>
			</ul>
